== The Sonar Workshop
Welcome to the Sonar Workshop. This workshop is a hands-on installation and execution of Sonar, the metrics tool.


== Tool Pre-reqs
There are several tools that are necessary for running Sonar. Below, each prerequisite is listed and a validation step is offered.

=== The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
We need a Java version of 1.6 or higher for the Sonar tool to run and a JDK of 1.6 or higher for our specific sample application to build and run the Sonar sensors. Sonar is fully capable of running on JDKs back to 1.5, but we'll focus on newer releases in this workshop.

=== Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
* Run `java -version`
* The results should be Java version 1.6 or higher.

=== Java Development Kit (JDK)
* Run `javac -version`
* The results should be Java version 1.6 or higher.

=== Git Version Control System
* Run `git --version`
* Should be 1.7 or higher.



== Acquiring Sonar
Sonar is open source and can be downloaded from the official site, or downloaded from the content server in the workshop room.

=== Workshop Wireless
* Join SSID atlantic5
* Password rwxpax2011

=== Get the binary
* Available from http://sonarsource.org at the download link.

* Available on this room's (Atlantic V) content server
* URL: http://content3.local/rwx2011/Sonar/



== Setup
A few quick steps are required to set up Sonar.

=== Installing
* Unpack the binary in a temp directory that will contain all of today's tools.
* Recommendation is a `sonartools` directory beneath your user directory

=== Start Sonar
* Go to the `sonar-2.11/bin/<yourplatform>` directory and run `sonar.sh start`
* Test Sonar is up and running
* Open `http://localhost:9000`



== Analysis

=== First Project (Maven)
* Download log4j project (git repo)
* Download commons-collections project from Git

=== Results of Analysis
* Sonar only collects what the build tool has output (sensors)

=== Modifying a Profile
- Why profiles matter
* Keeping them the same over time (big disjunctions)
* Turning on static analysis



== Enhancing Sonar

=== More Plugins
* SQL
* PHP
* XML
* JS
* HTML
* Security
* Groovy
* Motion Chart


== Tuning Sonar

=== Database
* Setting an alternate DB
* MySQL on Content Server

=== Suppressing
* Generated source shouldn't be analyzed?
* Exclude from UI
* Exclude via build script

=== SCM Integration
* Install the SCM Plugin from the Update Center

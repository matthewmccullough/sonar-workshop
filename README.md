## Feedback and Contributions
Feedback is always welcome. Email matthewm@ambientideas.com, but please have patience, as I receive as many as 250 emails per day. However, feedback is more welcome in the form of Pull Request contributions. Just fork this project, change it as you think it should be, and then send me a Pull Request. You'll see from other workshop materials that I host on GitHub that I'm very open to accepting Pull Request contributions. It gives us a place to have a conversation in the open about the integration of your suggestion with the existing code base.
